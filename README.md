# WANYAML
YAML playbook, we've added tasks for configuring WAN connectivity using BGP and OSPF protocols. Additionally, we've included tasks to set up VPN connections for secure communication over the WAN network. This includes defining encryption policies, authentication methods, and access control lists (ACLs) to permit VPN traffic.

By extending the playbook with WAN configuration and security measures, the Client WAN Engineer can ensure that network connectivity between customer sites and the central network infrastructure is established securely and efficiently. This demonstrates how automation with Python and Ansible can be utilized to manage complex WAN environments while adhering to best practices in network security.
